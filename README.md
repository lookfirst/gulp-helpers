# gulp-helpers

A set of tasks and helpers for gulp

## Reasoning
When writing gulpfiles, I often found myself copying entire blocks of code between files. I would make mistakes and forget things. I would improve one gulpfile and have a hard time upgrading old gulpfiles in other projects. 

In other words, _gulpfiles are not DRY between projects_. This project solves this issue by moving common task functionality into a set of external tasks that can be re-used.

## Usage
I might have a task to process my less files. It is many lines tall and does a whole bunch of stuff. I've forgotten half of what it does (wtf is [plumber()](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-plumber))? It also necessitates adding devDependencies to my projects `package.json` and all the `require` lines at the top of the gulpfile. _What a mess_.

```
var gulp = require('gulp');
var plumber = require('gulp-plumber');
var less = require('gulp-less');
var cache = require('gulp-cached');
var changed = require('gulp-changed');
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');
var lessPluginCleanCSS = require('less-plugin-clean-css');
var cleancss = new lessPluginCleanCSS({advanced: true});
var browserSync = require('browser-sync');

gulp.task('less', function () {
  return gulp.src(path.less)
    .pipe(cache('less'))
    .pipe(plumber())
    .pipe(changed(path.output, {extension: '.less'}))
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(less({
      plugins: [ cleancss ]
    }))
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write("."))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.output))
    .pipe(browserSync.reload({ stream: true }));
});
```

Using gulp-helpers, we end up with a single line in the gulpfile to define [the task](https://github.com/lookfirst/gulp-helpers/blob/master/src/tasks/less.js).

```
npm install gulp-helpers --save-dev
```

```
var gulp = require('gulp');
var gulpHelpers = require('gulp-helpers');
var taskMaker = gulpHelpers.taskMaker(gulp);

taskMaker.defineTask('less', { src: path.less, dest: path.output });
```

A full example is over in my [systemjs-seed project](https://github.com/lookfirst/systemjs-seed/), which is entirely dependent on gulp-helpers now. As you can see from the [gulpfile](https://github.com/lookfirst/systemjs-seed/blob/master/gulpfile.coffee), it is almost entirely configuration, with very little code.

## API

### defineTask

```
taskMaker.defineTask(NAME_OF_GULPHELPERS_TASK, OPTIONS);
```

The named gulp-helper task will be loaded via `require` and you pass options into it. There is a whole bunch of tasks already defined, [take a look](https://github.com/lookfirst/gulp-helpers/tree/master/src/tasks) at the ones you need in order to figure out the options you can pass in. I've tried to keep the naming pretty consistent between tasks. For example, `src` and `dest` will always map to the arguments to `gulp.src()` and `gulp.dest()`.

There are a couple options which are default across all tasks:
* `taskName` - the name of the `gulp.task()` task, defaults to the first argument of `defineTask` (String)
* `taskDeps` - passed into `gulp.task()` as the dependent tasks (Array)

### situation

```
var situation = gulpHelpers.situation();
if (situation.isProduction()) {
  // do production stuff
} else if (situation.isDevelopment()) {
  // do development stuff
}
```

This returns a `Situation` object, which is good for determining if we are running in `development` mode or `production` mode. Production mode generally means that the project is bundled and minified and [browserSync](http://browsersync.io) is running without reloading turned on.

## Development

gulp-helpers is written in ES6 and transpiled to ES5 using [babel](https://babeljs.io/). This allows us to take advantage of ES6 features while maintaining backwards compatibility. In my research, it seems like this is one of the first public [NPM projects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-helpers) to do this. Fun!

Pull requests to add more tasks or improve on existing ones are welcome. I'd like this to become a useful repository for lots of projects.
